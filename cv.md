### Reason for applying for a job 
My father bought me a PC “Byte” when I were 6. Tho, then I more played games, but I also wrote my first application on Basic language. My first work was tied with PC - I become PC repair specialist. I’m self-taught and got all my skills through practical experience - both at first in PC maintenance (way from an employee to an employer), and then in website development (from simple websites on WordPress to developing own modules for CMS). I decided to realize my vocation back in 2014, when I took the course of the PHP the developer, but after an events in personal life, I turned my career path to the other side from IT. Having worked several years in a completely different field, I lost the joy of daily activities and realized that I want to return and get improved in that what was bringing me satisfaction with the result and the pleasure of solving new and complex tasks. Technologies have made great strides in 5 years, the competition in the IT sector has become much higher, but during this time I also gained a lot of skills and life experience that you can’t learn in courses and don’t peek at stackoverflow. I have never given up to difficulties and challenges, and now I am going to meet them again.
